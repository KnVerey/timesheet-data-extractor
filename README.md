Timesheet Data Extractor
========================

This was one of my first ruby projects, built before Bitmaker Labs.
It processes the Excel timesheets used by Immigration and Refugee Board editors and produces a new Excel spreadsheet
of results. I built it as a more efficient way to compile data about long-term projects (previously done manually).
